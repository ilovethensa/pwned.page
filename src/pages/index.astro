        <!--Work in progress notice -->
        <p class="notice">
            <strong>Work in Progress!</strong><br /> This page is a work in progress.
            I'm currently working on adding more features and services, so stay tuned
            for updates!
        </p>
        <!--Project Introduction -->
        <p>
            Pwned.page is a personal project started by <strong
                >TheHolyTachanka</strong
            > to host privacy-conscious, open-source, and self-hosted alternatives
            to popular services. All services are currently running on a very hardened
            TMPFS-on-root NixOS server, ensuring a secure and reproducible environment.
            You can view the complete source code for the infrastructure on <a
                href="https://codeberg.org/ilovethensa/homelab"
                target="_blank">codeberg</a
            >.

        <!-- Goals and Vision-->
        <h2>What is the Goal of Pwned.page?</h2>
        <p>
            The goal of Pwned.page is to provide a safe, open, and
            privacy-respecting set of tools for users who want to take control
            of their online presence. With growing concerns over data privacy
            and the increasing centralization of the internet, it's more
            important than ever to have alternatives that prioritize your
            privacy and security.
        </p>
        <h3>Currently Available Services</h3>
        <p>
            You can explore the services I currently offer in the <strong
                ><a href="/services">Services</a></strong
            > page. These services are designed with privacy and security in mind,
            offering you alternatives to some of the most popular platforms.
        </p>
        <!-- Invitation for feedback or contributions -->
        <h3>Get Involved</h3>
        <p>
            Pwned.page is an open project, and I'm always looking for ways to
            improve it. If you have suggestions, feedback, or would like to
            contribute, feel free to reach out! You can also check out the
            source code on my GitHub repository.
        </p>
        <!-- Future Plans -->
        <h3>What's Coming Next?</h3>
        <p>
            I'm planning to add more services that focus on privacy,
            decentralization, and security. Some upcoming features include:
